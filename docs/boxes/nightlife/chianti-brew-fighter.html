    <p><strong>Local Craft Beer Pub in Florence</strong><br><br>

    Chianti Brew Fighter is a pub located on Via Pisana, just outside Porta San Frediano, in a lively and characterful neighborhood that buzzes both day and night. It's a favorite among locals and sits well off the usual tourist paths.<br><br>

    We recommend Chianti Brew Fighter because it's a place where you can truly breathe in the spirit of the brew revolution. The owners produce their beers in Radda in Chianti, right in the heart of wine country—where they stand their ground and fight for their passion: beer.<br><br>

    At the pub, you'll find mostly their own beers, which, despite being craft-made, maintain high and consistent quality batch after batch. Thanks to their dedication and strong presence in the market, they also host a rotating selection of “friendly beers” from collaborators—available on tap, in bottles, and in cans.
