<h2>Rosticceria Tavola Marocchina</h2>
<br>
<p>
Just steps from the Mercato Centrale, Rosticceria Tavola Marocchina is a humble,<br>
family-run spot that serves up some of the most authentic Moroccan food you'll find<br>
outside of Morocco. The food is homemade, the bread is baked fresh, and the prices<br>
are almost too good to be true. You order at the counter, and the dishes are brought<br>
to your table. The vibe is relaxed, welcoming, and filled with regulars who know what's good.<br><br>
